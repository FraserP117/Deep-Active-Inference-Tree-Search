## Development Version
The current version is hosted in the "sensor-uncertainty" branch in the file:

```
Deep-Active-Inference-for-Partially-Observable-MDPs/ai_pomdp_agent_ACT_No_VAE.py
```
As it is based upon the implementation from: https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.03622 A salient feature of my implementation is that I do away with the Variational Autoencoder (hence my naming convention).
