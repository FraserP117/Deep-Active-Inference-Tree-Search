* initial_state_belief:
	what is this exactly?

* action selection in expand_AcT seems to always return the same actions
	- yep, only ever selecting action "0"

* Node.pred_mean_state:
	- should we use this or a sample from the distributon parameterised by "pred_mean_state"?

* using expand_AcT instead of tree_policy_AcT means that the tree is not being properly built?
	- probably should use tree_policy_AcT even for 1-ply planning.
